👋 Hey, I’m Eglantine

👀 I believe in web3 as an accelerator for a cultural evolution based on collaboration, renewed dynamics and appreciation for the system as a whole. 
I'm interested in regenerative communities and agriculture, as well as the creation of tech solutions to fund and preserve them.

🌱 I’m currently researching about tokenomics, digitalization of data and assets, and agritech. Also going back to the roots by learning about ancient wisdom.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and proposals that aim to impulse local governments and communities to fund and preserve public goods, enhance the ecosystem
health and improve overall community wellbeing.
